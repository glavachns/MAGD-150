# MAGD Projects
Lab 5:
I built an interactive p5.js sketch that meets the assignments requirements such as a 400x400 canvas, continuous animation, two user interactions, at least two conditional checks, and a loop.
Lab 6:
I created a themed p5.js sketch on a 400x400 canvas that uses arrays for positions and motion. I logged an array length to the console, filled an array with a for loop, used those array values to animate shapes, and set one array element to follow the mouse.
Lab 7:
I made a sketch that draws text on a 400x400 canvas. It creates two arrays, fills them using array methods inside for loops, logs the arrays to the console, combines them into a third array, and displays the arrays and random picks on the canvas with text.
